A typed, compiled language, Golang offers immense performance without the usually required expertise. Some features of Go are the vast standard library and excellent concurrency support. However, Go is not a perfect language, and often has strange pitfalls or is not applicable in certain use cases. For example, GUI libraries are some immature, and the language only implemented `Min` and `Max` functions in 1.21 (released September 2023).
